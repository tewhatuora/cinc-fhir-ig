                              modifier extensions.


                              Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
                              of any elements on Resource or DomainResource

                                    set of resources that are conformant to a
                                    particular profile, and allows clients that

                                    profile and to find appropriate data. For a
                                    client, it means the system will search by

                                          that modifies the understanding of the
                                          element in which it is contained
                                          and/or the understanding of the
                                          containing element's descendants.
                                          Usually modifier elements provide
                                          negation or qualification. To make the
                                          use of extensions safe and manageable,
                                          there is a strict set of governance
                                          applied to the definition and use of
                                          extensions. Though any implementer can
                                          define an extension, there is a set of
                                          requirements that SHALL be met as part
                                          of the definition of the extension.
                                          Applications processing a resource are
                                          required to check for modifier
                                          extensions.


                                          Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change
                                          the meaning of any elements on

                          narrative to ensure clinical safety.

                              If both Reference.type and Reference.reference are
                              populated and Reference.reference is a FHIR URL,
                              both SHALL be consistent.

                              to. References are URLs that are relative to
                              http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/ e.g.
                              "Patient" is a reference to
                              http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient.
                              Absolute URLs are only allowed for logical models
                              (and can only be used in references in logical
                              models, not resources).

                              available through a FHIR server, or because there
                              is no way for the author of the resource to
                              convert a known identifier to an actual location.
                              There is no requirement that a

                              actually exposed as a FHIR instance, but it SHALL
                              point to a business concept that would be expected
                              to be exposed as a FHIR instance, and that
                              instance would need to be of a FHIR resource type
                              allowed by the reference.

                                              an extension, there is a set of

                                        extension, there is a set of
                                        requirements that SHALL be met as part
                                        of the definition of the extension.
                                        Applications processing a resource are
