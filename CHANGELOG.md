# v0.1.5 (2023-07-19) COVID Questionnaire improvements

- Revised, and made consistent, canonical identifiers for three COVID-related Questionnaires
  - `COVIDInitialHealthAssessmentQuestionnaire` [was QuestionTemplate-CitC-COVID19-InitialAssessment]
  - `COVIDRegularHealthCheckQuestionnaire` [was QuestionTemplate-CitC-COVID19-RegularHealthCheck]
  - `COVIDVaccinationSurveyQuestionnaire` [was Questionnaire-COVID-VaccinationSurveyQuestionnaire]
  
    All the above identifiers are categorised "use":"official", with a use.period starting from `2023-07-19`
    The former legacy identifiers remain, but in "use":"temp" status with their use.period.**end** date set to `2023-07-19`
    After these revisions, all four COVID Questionnaires now have consistent identifier values (`COVIDPublicHealthHistoryQuestionnaire` being the fourth and most recent addition)

- Revised **official URLs** for the same three COVID Questionnaires to:
    https://build.fhir.org/ig/tewhatuora/cinc-fhir-ig/*Questionnaire-COVID-InitialHealthAssessment*
    https://build.fhir.org/ig/tewhatuora/cinc-fhir-ig/*Questionnaire-COVID-RegularHealthCheck*
    https://build.fhir.org/ig/tewhatuora/cinc-fhir-ig/*Questionnaire-COVID-VaccinationSurvey*
  
      These Official URLs are now more logical and also consistent with the recently added 
      Questionnaire at URL:
  https://build.fhir.org/ig/tewhatuora/cinc-fhir-ig/Questionnaire-COVID-PublicHealthHistory
