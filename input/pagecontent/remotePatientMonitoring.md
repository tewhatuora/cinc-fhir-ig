### Remote Patient Monitoring in FHIR 


### Patient Onboarding

The Remote Patient Monitoring Flows and Experience for any given Patient are centered around their CarePlan. At the time of a Patients commencement in the RPM programme this CarePlan along with a series of related resources are created.

### Data Gathering

Throughout the period of care, Questionnaires are used to gather clinical insights into the Patients wellbeing and experience, along with feedback surrounding the quality of experience surrounding the Piki Te Ora App.

Observations are generated via a Series of Smart Devices, that interact with the Piki App, that are then posted to the Shared Care API.
